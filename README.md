HealthHub: A web application on top of a relational database
Created by Jacob Million and Michael Carrion for Coms4111 Databases Columbia University

HealthHub is an application that allows users to track diseases and the states they are interested in.
Users can also post to a discussion board to ask questions, and reply to questions posted by other users. The home page displays links to various pages of interest, such as the number and type of diseases in each state. It also displays the current riskiest state, determined by the total number of diseases present in the state.

The ER diagram below shows the relational database the application is built on top of:
