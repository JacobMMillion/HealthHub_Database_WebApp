# W4111 Project1 Part3: HealthHub

HealthHub is an application that allows users to track diseases and the states they are interested in.
Users can also post to a discussion board to ask questions, and reply to questions posted by other users.

The home page displays links to various pages of interest, such as the number and type of diseases in each state.
It also displays the current riskiest state, determined by the total number of diseases (irregardless of the type) present in the state.
